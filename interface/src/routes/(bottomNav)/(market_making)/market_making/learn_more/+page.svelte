 1. What is market making?

💧 Market making is the act of adding liquidity to a market.
Market makers place both buy and sell orders — so traders can always find someone to trade with.
It keeps prices stable, spreads tight, and trading smooth.

2. Why is liquidity so important?

🌊 Liquidity is the lifeblood of any market.
High liquidity means trades happen instantly and with minimal price slippage.
Without it, markets feel “dead” — even good assets can’t be traded easily

3. What are the benefits of market making?

⚙️ Market making helps everyone:

Traders get fairer prices and faster trades.
Projects get healthier token performance.
Exchanges get more active and attractive markets.


4. What is HuFi?

🚀 HuFi is short for Human-Fi — a decentralized coordination layer for liquidity.
With HuFi, anyone can create a campaign to boost liquidity of any token pair on an exchange.
You just define a target pair and deposit rewards (in USDT, HMT, or other tokens).
Then others — called liquidity actors — trade that pair to earn your rewards.

5. What is Mr.Market?

🤖 Mr.Market is a decentralized, autonomous market-making tool.
Instead of trusting a traditional, private “black-box” market maker,
Mr.Market runs transparently on TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)
— powered by open-source code, verifiable logic, and real data.

It automates liquidity operations safely, without human control or hidden fees.

6. How does it work?

🎯 Example:
You want to improve liquidity of ABC/USDT on Binance.
You start a campaign and stake 1000 USDT in rewards.
Traders see your campaign, start trading the pair, and earn those rewards.
Result: ABC/USDT becomes more active, tighter spreads, more real liquidity.

7. Why is this important?

🔥 Because liquidity is power.
With HuFi and Mr.Market, liquidity creation is open to everyone — not just institutions.
Communities, investors, and even individuals can now empower tokens directly.
It turns liquidity into a public good — transparent, fair, and decentralized.
