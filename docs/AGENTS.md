When creating docs, use English, keep it simple stupid, don't overcomplicate it, only write 1 doc for each feature, and make sure it's easy to understand. If have different docs for different topics, join them to a file.

When the code is updated, update the related docs as well.

Update CHANGELOG.md when the code is updated, keep the CHANGELOG.md simple, Keep each changes in one line.
