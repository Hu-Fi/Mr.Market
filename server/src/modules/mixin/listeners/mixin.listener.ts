/**
 * MixinListener
 *
 * This listener service handles events related to the release of tokens on the Mixin network.
 * It processes the 'mixin.release' event, validates event data, updates order states, and manages
 * the transaction of tokens, including recording release history.
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - SnapshotsService: Service for interacting with Mixin snapshots.
 * - ExchangeService: Service for interacting with exchange-related data and operations.
 * - CustomConfigService: Service for reading and modifying custom configuration settings.
 * - Helper functions: Utilities for validating data, managing timestamps, and calculating fees.
 * - STATE_TEXT_MAP: Mapping of state text for various order states.
 *
 * Events:
 * - 'mixin.release': Event triggered to release tokens on the Mixin network.
 *
 * Methods:
 *
 * - constructor: Initializes the service with the injected SnapshotsService, ExchangeService, and CustomConfigService.
 *
 * - handleReleaseTokenEvent(e: MixinReleaseTokenEvent): Handles the 'mixin.release' event.
 *   Validates asset and user IDs, checks release history, subtracts fees, sends the transaction,
 *   updates order state, and records release history.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Spot order execution process (Here is the step 5)
 *  1. Loop snapshots on mixin, find incoming transfer
 *  2. Send create spot order event to spot.listener.ts
 *  3. If basic checks are passed, send place order event, write to db in exchange.listener.ts
 *  4. Wait for state update scheduler to update order state, in exchange.service.ts
 *  5. If the state updated to succeess, send release token event to mixin.listener.ts
 *
 * - The service ensures that the event data is valid and the transaction is processed securely.
 * - Error handling is implemented to log and manage errors during the release process.
 * - The service updates the order state and records release history to maintain accurate tracking of transactions.
